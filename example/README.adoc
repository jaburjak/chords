= Example Chords project

This is a bare-bones example project that demonstrates two main features of
the Chords library:

* Generating printable PDF document with song lyrics. +
For source code, see `song_to_pdf.php`. For example of the generated PDF file,
see `okor.pdf`.
* Exporting chord diagram as an SVG image. +
For source code, see `chord_to_svg.php`. For example of the generated image,
see `C.svg`.

The song used in this example is a Czech folk song “Okoř”.
